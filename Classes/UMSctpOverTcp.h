/*
 sctp over tcp is a encapsulation used to transport the features of sctp over a tcp link
 in the case there is no support in the kernel for sctp anymore (MacOS 11.0 and above)
 or if NAT is in the way. It is not in any RFC but comes handy for internal testing use
 of upper layers.
 
 sctp packets sent over tcp lack the feature of two sides connecting at the same time from
 both ends. This means one side must be passively listening for this to work. Keep this in
 mind when using for M2PA. In M3UA, its always a client which connects to a server.
 
 sctp packets are encapsulated in a tcap packet which is prepended with the following header
 stucture. in addition to that at setup, a header is sent which contains the "local ip" addresses
 as in the normal SCTP config so they are matched against the IP addresses in the configuration
 of the server side. This is necessary because the source port might be something else due to NAT
 or portforwarding.
